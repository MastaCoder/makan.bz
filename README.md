This is the repo where I'll be hosting the static design of my website. Feel free to look around the code and find new ways to improve your existing code or try out my components.

## Do NOT Copy Libraries
The MDBootstrap version on the website is licensed and hosted on a seperate server. Use of the library can get your website taken down since you won't have a valid license to use it. Feel free to grab a few copy from the "Get Started" guide at https://mdbootstrap.com/ or purchase your own copy.
